Our game -- Puzzle Smash:
	The game is played by trying to win the puzzles that occur on the lower part of the screen. When a puzzle is completed successfully, the avatar on top will defeat the monster he's fighting, and if the puzzle is failed then the monster will attack him and he'll lose a heart. The game is won by getting to the end of the enemies (currently there are 4), and lost by losing all three hearts.
	The three puzzles currently in the game are:
		- Whack-a-mole (self explanatory)
		- Tap-it (tap the circles in time and in order, like a rhythm game)
		- Spin-It (align the wheel to absorb the the falling orbs of the appropriate type).

	The idea of the game is that it's very extensible; more mini-games/puzzles can easily be added, and the animations on top can be fleshed out to give the game an RPG feel. What we have here is a small sampling of what the game could become. The game is also built in Unity and could be easily deployed to Android and iOS -- we targeted only Android for simplicity and because we don't have an iTunes Developer Account.
